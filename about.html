      <h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>
      <p>This website was created to help students like me who are preparing for AP Physics 1 and AP Precalculus exams but struggle to find free, quality practice problems online. I wanted to build a place where anyone can access practice questions easily and improve their skills without worrying about paywalls or complicated sign-ups. It’s all about making learning more accessible and helping students feel confident going into their exams!</p>

      <h2>Who Made This?</h2>
      <p>I’m a 10th grader passionate about science and math, and I created this website as a way to share resources with other students. Since I know how tough it can be to find good practice materials, I decided to put in the effort to build this site myself. I’m excited to keep adding problems and improving the site so it can be a helpful tool for students everywhere.</p>
